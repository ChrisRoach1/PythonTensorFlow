# PythonTensorFlow

This repo contains two files, both of which are examples of using the Tensorflow library in python.
The "model.h5" file is a compiled model that belongs with the "MovieReviews.py" file.

If you wish to download and run these files you must have the following packages installed:

- tensorflow
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

It is important to note that you must have python version >=3.5 and pip >=19.0 to run tensorflow, I have found that python
3.8 is not currently supported.
